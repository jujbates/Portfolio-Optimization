    "The world of financial asset management is difficult to understand. It takes time and money to research and analyze assets. Some of the most interesting and high profile assets are assets in the form of securities. In the United States, financial securities are simply tradable assets such as debts, equities, and derivatives. Nowadays, the financial asset that most U.S. citizens think of is equities and more specifically common stocks. They have begun to believe it is the best indicator of economic growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sure you can buckle down and evaluate stock after stock, company after company, CEO after CEO, quarter after quarter. But is there an easier way for common folks without the financial know how or even just time. ETFs, Exchange-Traded Funds are portfolios that are traded on stock exchanges just like any other stock. ETF portfolios can contain assets such as stocks, bonds, currencies, and/or commodities. This makes it much easier for an everyday investor to invest with lower risk and little to no supervision. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common ETFs follow the S&P 500 index (^GSPC)  like The Vanguard Group (VOO), iShares (IVV), and State Street Corporation (SPY). The S&P is a capitalization-weighted index, which means it indexes the equities by allocating with capitalization, the stock’s share price multiplied by the number of outstanding shares.\n"
